# MergeMP4
Merges multiple .mp4 files into a single .mp4 file.

This is a .bat file that uses ffmpeg to merge multiple .mp4 files into a single file.  

I originally made this because OBS ( https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio ) currently doesn't have a pause feature, so you have to start and stop recordings.  Doing so creates a bunch of seperate files that you would have to re-encode into a single file.  With this batch file, you can merge multiple .mp4 files and get a single file without having to re-encode all of the files.

**This batch file requires ffmpeg.exe**
You can download ffmpeg.exe from the following link: https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
