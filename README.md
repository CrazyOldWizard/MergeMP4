# MergeMP4
Merges multiple .mp4 files into a single .mp4 file.
This is a .bat file that uses ffmpeg to merge multiple .mp4 files into a single file.  I originally made this because OBS currently have a pause feature, so you have to start and stop recordings.  With this, you can still get a single output file after recording videos.
