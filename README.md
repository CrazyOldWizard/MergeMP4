# MergeMP4
Merges multiple .mp4 files into a single .mp4 file.

This is a .bat file that uses ffmpeg to merge multiple .mp4 files into a single file.  

I originally made this because OBS ( https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio ) currently have a pause feature, so you have to start and stop recordings.  With this, you can still get a single output file after recording videos.
